Simple Ray Tracer
=================

"srt" is a simple ray tracer. Currently it only support rendering a scene
containing only spheres. The scene is setup using a CLI.

Render output selection
-----------------------
As default visual output a .tga file will be created which can be viewed by
any image viewer. The .tga file is created using the included ssil
(Small and Simle Image Library).

If you dont want the the included ssil to handle the visual output, you can
write your own code or use ssgl (Small and Simple Graphics Library) to
open a window with the rendered scene. See Makefile how to disable ssil and
use ssgl.

If you prefer writing your own code for a visual output you have the data for
the rendered scene available in the variable 'image'. The data in 'image' is
an array of pixels, starting with the pixel at the lower left corner and then
continuing with increasing x value. Each pixel is stored in three bytes
starting with the red component followed by the green and then the blue.

Building
--------
Building srt is as simple as:
   make
