Simple Ray Tracer
=================

srt is a simple ray tracer. Currently it only support rendering a sphere, but
more is about to come.

Configuration
-------------
Without any configuration srt will not perform any visual output. To make a
visual output you can either use ssil (Small and Simle Image Library) to
generate a .tga image, or you can write your own code to display the result.

ssil can be found at https://github.com/mrjojo/ssil. See Makefile for more
information about using it.

If you prefer writing your own code for a visual output you have the data for
the rendered scene available in the variable 'image'. The data in 'image' is
an array of pixels, starting with the pixel at the lower left corner and then
continuing with increasing x value. Each pixel is stored in three bytes
starting with the red component followed by the green and then the blue.

Building
--------
Building srt is as simple as:
   make
