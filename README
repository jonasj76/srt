Simple Ray Tracer
=================

srt is a simple ray tracer. Currently it only support rendering spheres with
a single color, but more is about to come.

Configuration
-------------
Without any configuration srt will not perform any visual output. To make a
visual output you can either use ssil (Small and Simle Image Library) to
generate a .tga image, use ssgl (Small and Simple Graphics Library) to
open a window with the rendered scene or write your own code to handle the
output.

See Makefile for more information about using ssil or ssgl.
ssil can be found at https://github.com/mrjojo/ssil.
ssgl can be found at https://github.com/mrjojo/ssgl.

If you prefer writing your own code for a visual output you have the data for
the rendered scene available in the variable 'image'. The data in 'image' is
an array of pixels, starting with the pixel at the lower left corner and then
continuing with increasing x value. Each pixel is stored in three bytes
starting with the red component followed by the green and then the blue.

Building
--------
Building srt is as simple as:
   make
